/**
 * Service used to determine the quality of an answer. The service uses the OpenAI API to verify the generated answer
 * using two techniques:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Answer to question: The answer is verified against the question. The answer is scored between 1 and 5. 5
 *     means the answer contains the answer to the proposed question completely. 1 means there is not match between
 *     the answer and the question at all.</li>
 *     <li>Answer from context: The answer is verified against the provided context. The answer is scored between 1 and
 *     5. 5 means the answer contains only facts from the context. 1 means there is not match between the answer and
 *     the provided context at all. If the answer contains exact phrases from the context, the score should be lower
 *     as well.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The class contains two main methods to ask for the separate scores. The method {@link #determineQualityOfAnswer(RAGObserver)}
 * combines the two scores into one object.
