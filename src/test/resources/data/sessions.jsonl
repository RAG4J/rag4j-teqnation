{"speakers": ["Jettro Coenradie", "Daniël Spee"], "title": "The Art of Questions: Creating a Semantic Search-Based Question-Answering System with LLMs", "description": "Ever thought about building your very own question-answering system? Like the one that powers Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant? Well, we've got something awesome lined up for you!In our hands-on workshop, we'll guide you through the ins and outs of creating a question-answering system. We prefer using Python for the workshop. We have prepared a GUI that works with python. If you prefer another language, you can still do the workshop, but you will miss the GUI to test your application. You'll get your hands dirty with vector stores and Large Language Models, we help you combine these two in a way you've never done before.You've probably used search engines for keyword-based searches, right? Well, prepare to have your mind blown. We'll dive into something called semantic search, which is the next big thing after traditional searches. It’s like moving from asking Google to search \"best pizza places\" to \"Where can I find a pizza place that my gluten-intolerant, vegan friend would love?\" – you get the idea, right?We’ll be teaching you how to build an entire pipeline, starting from collecting data from various sources, converting that into vectors (yeah, it’s more math, but it’s cool, we promise), and storing it so you can use it to answer all sorts of queries. It's like building your own mini Google!We've got a repository ready to help you set up everything you need on your laptop. By the end of our workshop, you'll have your question-answering system ready and running.So, why wait? Grab your laptop, bring your coding hat, and let's start building something fantastic together. Trust us, it’s going to be a blast!Some of the highlights of the workshop:Use a vector store (OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, Weaviate)Use a Large Language Model (OpenAI, HuggingFace, Cohere, PaLM, Bedrock)Use a tool for content extraction (Unstructured, Llama)Create your pipeline (Langchain, Custom)", "room": "Kalvermelk 2c (Workshops)", "time": "Wed 11:00 - 12:45", "tags": ["Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning", "Intermediate", "Java", "Python"]}
